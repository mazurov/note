\section{Results and summary}
\label{sec:results}

In summary, the fractions of $\Upsilon(1,2,3S)$ states originating from $\chi_b(1,2,3P)$ 
radiative decays has been measured on the full data sample collected by LHCb in 2011 and 2012 
at center of mass energies of 7 and 8 TeV respectively, as a function of the $\Upsilon$ 
transverse momentum. Results are shown in the Figure~\ref{fig:results} and 
Tables~\ref{tab:frac:ups1s_final}--\ref{tab:frac:ups3s_final}.

The results in this study extend previous LHCb measurements to considerably
more decays, higher transverse momentum regions and increased statistical
precision.
