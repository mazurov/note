A study of \chib production at \lhcb is performed on a proton-proton collisions
data set, corresponding to 3\invfb integrated luminosity, collected at center-
of-mass energies of \sqs=7 and 8 TeV. Radiative \chib transitions to
\Y1S, \Y2S and \Y3S are reconstructed, where the $\Upsilon(nS)$, indicated generally as $\Upsilon$ in the following, decays in two muon. 
The fraction of $\Upsilon$ originating from \chib decays
are measured as a function of $\Upsilon$ transverse momentum in the \lhcb rapidity range
$2.0 < y^{\Upsilon} < 4.5$. The analyzed transverse momentum ranges for decays
to \Y1S, \Y2S and \Y3S are $6<p_T^{\Y1S}<40\gevc$, $18<p_T^{\Y2S}<40\gevc$ and
$24<p_T^{\Y3S}<40\gevc$, respectively. The measurement of
\Y3S fractions in radiative \chibThreeP decay is performed for the first time.
The measured \chiboneThreeP mass is $10{,}510 \pm 1.6\stat \pm
6\syst \mevcc$.
