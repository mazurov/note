{\bf v0.10.1}

Fix peak width scaling for $\chi_b \to \Y1S \gamma$

{\bf v0.10}

For $\Upsilon$ yields the Crystal Ball parameters were changed to the values that
were used in the previous analysis ($\alpha=2$, $n=5$) . Added pull histogram to
all $\Upsilon$ plots. Added fit plots for different $p_T^{\mumu}$ intervals for
$\Upsilon$ yields study (Figure~\ref{fig:upsilon:result:fits2011}). Added fit
probability (based on $\chi^2$) to all fit tables. In study of $\Upsilon$ yields
fits have very low probabilities --- interesting to compare them with
probability in the previous analysis.

Added fit plots for simulation data
Figures~[\ref{fig:mc:ups1s:fits1p},\ref{fig:mc:ups1s:fits2p}, \ref{fig:mc:ups1s:fits3p},
\ref{fig:mc:ups2s:fits}].

The right border of $p_T^{\Upsilon}$ intervals is extended to 40 \gevc.

The width of \chib yields in decays to \Y1S are fixed to the corresponding width
in Monte-Carlo scaled by 1.6 ($\pm 0.3$): all tables were updated.
Was added comparison with previous results (Figure~\ref{fig:frac}).
Updated figures in section related to selection efficiency - background
contribution (\%) is shown (Figure~\ref{fig:mc:eff:nominal}).




{\bf v0.9}

The following sections are basically ready for review:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Introduction~\ref{sec:introduction}.
\item Y signal extraction~\ref{sec:upsilon}.
% \item Chib signal extraction~\ref{sec:chib}.
% \item Selection efficiency~\ref{sec:eff}
% \item Y Fractions~\ref{sec:crosssec}
\end{enumerate}
