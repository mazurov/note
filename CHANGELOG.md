# Changelog v3.0

All comments from Zhenwei and Marco have been taken into account.

## Major changes:

- m(chi_b1(1P)) was fixed to 9887 MeV (not to 9892)
- Fixed issues with different resolution ratio differences between 2011 and 2012 data. (sigma(chi_b1(2P)) / sigma(chi_b1(1P)) and sigma(chi_b1(3P)) / sigma(chi_b1(1P))
- Jackknife error estimation is used in polarization study for ratio between weighted and unweighted events. Errors becomes much smaller.

## Comments:

- To Zhenwei: tables in section for systematic uncertainties are sorted by decay mode, not by uncertainty type, so it could look like table mixing in description of  uncertainty type

- To Marco: Table 3.5 Parameter of background c_0 is looks small, but if I will use polynomial of smaller order the fit will have bigger errors.
